## React Simple Instruction

You smell that? Do you smell that? React, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of React in the morning. You know, one time we had a site coded, for 12 days. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dumb bug. The smell, you know that JSX smell, the whole code. Smelled like... victory. Someday this projects's gonna end.
